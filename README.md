# Real-Time-Color-detection
Real-Time Color Detection using OpenCV and Pandas is a Python project that is developed to provide an engaging real-time color detection experience using a webcam. This project harnesses OpenCV for computer vision and Pandas for data management, enabling users to identify colors in real-time video streams.

# Key Features:

**Live Color Detection**: The application captures video from a webcam, allowing users to detect colors in real-time.

**Color Identification**: Using OpenCV, the tool identifies colors in the video stream and provides information such as the color name and its RGB values.

**Customizable Thresholds**: Users can fine-tune color detection thresholds to suit their specific preferences and requirements.

**Data Analysis with Pandas**: The application collects and manages color data using Pandas, facilitating further analysis or reporting.
