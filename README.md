# Color-detection-project
The process of detecting the name of any color in an image or video is known as color detection.
A color can be represented in around 16.5 million different ways.
OpenCV usually captures images and videos in 8-bit, unsigned integer, BGR format. 
Captured images can be considered as 3 matrices of BLUE, GREEN and RED with integer values ranges from 0 to 255.
We use the Webcam and a CSV database and according to the CSV database the number of shades that can be identified are 865 color names along with their RGB and hex values. 
Whenever the cursor hovers over the screen, it automatically shows the RGB shades color values along with its hex values. 
The main objective is to find exact color with accuracy and the application can be used to find colors from a real-time input (webcam).
